Hello! Welcome to my soundscape narrative, "Bad News in the Backcountry". It's an over the top story about two friends backpacking in the woods and is inspired by my own fears that I face when I venture outdoors. I worked pretty hard on layering sounds to create a coherent story and distinct sense of place, and I hope this all translates into the narrative. Anyway, I don't want to preface this too much and would much rather you experience the piece with a relatively open mind. Happy listening! Hope you enjoy.
